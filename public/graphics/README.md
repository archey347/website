## Camera Controls

The camera controls are equivelant in both CubeAndBunny.html and engine.html

### Camera Translation
```
Up/Down Arrow Keys         in/out
PageUp/PageDown            up/down
Left/Right Arrow Keys      left/right
```

To translate at a faster speed, hold down the ctrl key.

### Camera Orbit

Hold down the right mouse key (or the centre scroll wheel for engine.html), and drag the mouse to orbit the camera.

By using the scroll on a mouse, this will decrease/increase the radius of the camera's orbit.

## Controls for engine.html

To alter the speed of the engine, move the slider in the top right hand corner.

You can also change the amount of pistons in the engine. To do this, enter in a piston configuration in the input box underneath the slider, and press the go button.

A piston configuraiton is a set of integers, seperated by commas, where each integer is between 0 and 720.

### Examples

- `0, 480, 240` - 3 cylinder engine
- `0, 180, 540, 360` - 4 cylinder engine
- `0, 40, 80, 120, 160, 200, 240, 280, 320, 360` - 10 cylinder 'Mexican wave' engine
